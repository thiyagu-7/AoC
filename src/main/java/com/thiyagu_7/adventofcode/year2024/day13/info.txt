Button A: X+94, Y+34
Button B: X+22, Y+67
Prize: X=8400, Y=5400

Pressing button A 'x' times and button B 'y' times.

Part 2 is solving the equation (using Cramer's rule - similar to 2023 Day 24).
94x + 22y = 8400 (+10000000000000)
34x + 67y = 5400 (+10000000000000)

Also as two lines, x and y values is the intersection point of the two lines.
